Write your approximate application using RAPID(C)
</p>

### RAPID(C) is...
a tool that encodes “Redundant APproximation Implementation Dependency”, “C” is a variant of RAPID that enables “Continuous” configurable components.

RAPID(C) allows developers to explicitly express the approximation structure of applications, and users to customize application quality. By using mission values, application users have a simple mechanism to customize the quality outcomes under a given cost budget without the need to deal with more complex quality metrics.

It has following features:
* Encode explicit structural information
* Enable faster training time
* Provide runtime reconfiguration
* Minimum extra efforts from the developer
* Custom QoS from end-users
